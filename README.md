}
```

## Go basics

### Variables
- Variables allow you to read from and write to memory [3]
- 

- 
- In Go, accessing memory is type-safe, and you cannot use variables outside the scope of their declaration [3]
- 

## Go basics (Packages, variables, and functions)

### Packages
- EveryGo program is made up of packages [1]
- (Executable) Programs run in package `main` [1]
- Programs use packages by import paths [1]
- Convention â€“ package name is the same as the last element of the import path [1]

### Imports
- Import statements are written as such [1]
```go
import "fmt"
import "math"
```

- It is good style to group imports into a parenthesized ("factored") import statement [1]
- Example above is then written as
```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)
```

### Exported names
- Names in Go are exported when they begin with a capital letter [1]
- When importing a package, you can refer only to its exported names [1]
- Any unexported names are not accessible from outside the package [1]

### Functions
- A function can take zero or more arguments [1]
- The type comes after the parameter name [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/oMmhdD4U1IO)
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func add(a int, b int) int {
	return a + b
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(add(15, 37))
}
```

- When two or more consecutive named function parameters share a type, the type can be omitted from all but the last [1]
```go
a int, b int
```
to
```go
a, b int
```

- A function can return any number of results [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/DLbQ49HPv4Q)
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func addAndSub(a int, b int) (int, int) {
	return a + b, a - b
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(addAndSub(15, 37))
}
```

- Return values may be named [1]
- Named return values are treated as variables defined at the top of the function [1]
- Names of named return values should be used to document the meaning of the return values [1]
- A `return` statement without arguments returns the named return values ("naked" return) [1]
- Naked return statements should only be used in short functions as they can harm readability in longer functions [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/NHQuTq4DvhB)
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func add(a int, b int) (sum int) {
	sum = a + b
	return
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(add(40, 2))
}
```

### Variables
- `var` statement declares a (list of) variable(s); the type is last [1]
- `var` statement can be at package or function level [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/kcsD53Yxlel)
```go
package main

import "fmt"

var one int

func main() {
	var two, three int
	one = 1
	two = 2
	three = 3

	fmt.Println(one, two, three)
}
```

### Variables with initializers
- A var declaration can include initializers, one per variable [1]
- If an initialzer is present, thee type can be omitted, the variable will take the type of the initializer [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/laaSQ0qR5Pj)
```go
package main

import "fmt"

var one, two int = 1, 2

func main() {
	var three = 3
	var isTrue, helloWorld = true, "Hello, world!"

	fmt.Println(one, two, three, isTrue, helloWorld)
}
```

### Short variable declarations
- Inside of a function, the `:=` short assigment statement (short variable declaration) can be used in place of a `var` declaration with implicit type [1]
- Outside of a function, every statement begins with a keyword (`var`, `func`, etc.); the `:=` is not available [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/zF5twQUWXrR)
```go
package main

import "fmt"

// one, two := 1, 2 is not available
var one, two int = 1, 2

func main() {
	// var three = 3
    three := 3
	// var isTrue, helloWorld = true, "Hello, world!"
    isTrue, helloWorld := true, "Hello, world!"

	fmt.Println(one, two, three, isTrue, helloWorld)
}
```

### Basic types
- bool
- string
- int, int8, int16, int32, int64
- uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, uintptr
- byte (alias for uint8)
- rune (alias for int32, represents a Unicode code point)
- float32, float64
- complex64, complex128
- The int, uint, and uintptr types are usually 32 bits wide on 32-bit systems and 64 bits wide on 64-bit systems [1]
- When you need an integer value you should use int unless you have a specific reason to use a sized or unsigned integer type [1]

### Zero values
- Variables declared without an explicit initial value are given their _zero value_ [1]
- Zero value is:
  - 0 for numeric types
  - false for boolean type
  - "" (empty string) for string type

### Type conversions
- The expression `T(v)` converts the value `v` to the type `T` [1]
- In Go, assignment between items of different type requires an explicit conversion [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/eojq2nHzkEd)
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	a := 3
	b := 7
	f := float64(a*b + a*a - b*b)
	var res int = int(f)
	fmt.Println(a, b, res)
}
```

### Type inference
- When declaring a variable without specifying an explicit type, the variable's type is inferred from the value on the right hand side [1]
- When the right hand side of the declaration is typed, the new variable is of that same type [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/OariO-P_McJ)
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var a int
	b := a

	fmt.Printf("%T %T\n", a, b)
}
```

- When the right hand side of the declaration contains an untyped numeric constant, the type of the new variable depends on the precision of the value [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/9uiCqlhrS0i)
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	a := 1
	b := 2.1
	c := 3 + 0i

	fmt.Printf("%T %T %T\n", a, b, c)
}
```

### Constants
- Constants are declared using the `const` keyword [1]
- Constants can be character, string, boolean, or numeric values [1]
- Constants _cannot_ be declared using the `:=` shorthand syntax [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/gCq4wYL2Rxl)
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	const a = "Hello, world!"
	const b = 3.14
	const c = true

	fmt.Printf("%T %T %T\n", a, b, c)
}

```

### Numeric constants
- Numeric constants are high-precision values [1]
- An untyped constant takes the type needed by its context [1]

## Go basics (Flow control statements: for, if, else, switch, and defer)

### For
- `for` loop is the only looping construct in Go [1]
- Basic `for` loop has thrree components separated by semicolons [1]:
  - init statement: executed before the first iteration
  - condidtion expression: evaluated before every iteration
  - post statement: executed at the end of every iteration
- init statement is often a short variable declaration [1]
- Variables declared in the init statement are only visible in the scope of the `for` statement [1]
- Loop stops iterating once the boolean condition expression evaluates to `false` [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/Yh8jRtIdbuT)
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	sum := 0
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		sum += i
	}
	fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

- init and post statements are optional
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/-8ihiw0pxlX)
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	sum :=1
	// the semicolons (";") an be dropped
	for ; sum < 1000; {
		sum += sum
	}
	fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

- Go doesn't not have a `while` keyword, howver, using Go's `for` without the init and post statements is euqal to a while loop [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/b0CRVhku7eS)
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	count := 0
	for count < 1000 {
		count += 1
	}
	fmt.Println(count)
}
```

- The condition expression defaults to true; omitting the loop condition leads to an infinite loop [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/oNIinSe8rFl)
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	count := uint32(0)
	var largeNum uint32 = 1<<32 - 1

	for {
		// adding break statement to not loop forever
		if count == largeNum {
			break
		}
		count += 1
	}

	fmt.Println(count)
}
```

### If
- Expression does not need to be surrounded by parentheses [1]
- The braces `{ }` are required [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/MI30Ok5BIWQ)
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	for i := 1; i <= 100; i++ {
		if i%3 == 0 {
			fmt.Print("Fizz")
		}

		if i%5 == 0 {
			fmt.Print("Buzz")
		}

		if i%3 != 0 && i%5 != 0 {
			fmt.Print(i)
		}

		fmt.Print("\n")
	}
}
```

- The `if` statement can start with a shorthand statement to execute before the conndition [1]
- Variables declared by the statement are only in scope until the end of the `if` [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/Ej7PBIzb9Ao)
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func calcApparelSalesTaxMA(amount float64) float64 {
	if diff := amount - 175.00; diff > 0.0 {
		return diff * 0.0625
	}
	return 0.0
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(
		calcApparelSalesTaxMA(99.37),
		calcApparelSalesTaxMA(238.49),
	)
}
```

- Variables declared inside an `if` short statement are also available inside any of the `else` blocks [1]

### Switch
- `switch` statement is a shorteer way to write a sequence of `if - else` statements [1]
- Switch cases need to be constants, and the values don't need to be integers [1]
- In Go, only the selected case is run, not all the cases that follow; the `break` statement that is needed at the end of each switch case in other languages, is not needed in Go [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground]()
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"runtime"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Print("Go runs on ")
	switch os := runtime.GOOS; os {
	case "darwin":
		fmt.Println("OS X.")
	case "linux":
		fmt.Println("Linux.")
	default:
		// freebsd, openbsd,
		// plan9, windows...
		fmt.Printf("%s.\n", os)
	}
}
```

- Switch cases evaluate from top to bottom; stopping when a case succeeds [1]
- Switch without a condition is the same as `switch true`; this construct can be a clean way to write long if-then-else chains [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground]()
```go

```

### Defer
- `defer` statement defers the execution of a function until the surrounding  function returns [1]
- Deferred call's arguments are evaluated immediately, but the function call is not executed until the surrounding function returns [1]
- Deferred function calls are pushed onto a stack; when a function returns, its deferred calls are executed LIFO (last-in-first-out order) [1]
- https://go.dev/blog/defer-panic-and-recover

## Go basics (More types: structs, slices, and maps)

### Pointers
- Pointers in Go hold the memory address of a value [1]
- Type `*T` is a pointer to a `T` value [1]
- A pointer's zero value is `nil` [1]
- `&` operator generates a pointer to its operand [1]
- `*` operator denotes the pointer's underlying value (also known as "dereferencing" or "indirecting") [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground]()
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	i := 42
	fmt.Printf("%p %v\n", &i, i)

	p := &i
	fmt.Printf("%p %v\n", p, *p)

	*p = 21
	fmt.Printf("%p %v\n", &i, i)
	fmt.Printf("%p %v\n", p, *p)
}
```

- Go has no pointer arithmetic [1]

### Structs
- `struct` is a collection of fields [1]
- Struct fields are accessed using a dot [1]
- Struct fields can also be accessed through a struct pointer [1]
  - To access the field of a struct with a struct pointer `p`, we could write `(*p).Field` [1]
  - For a shorter notation, the explicit dereference can be ommitted; instead of `(*p).Field, `p.Field` can be written instead [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground]()
```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Rectangle struct {
	Height int
	Width int
}

func main() {
	r := Rectangle{3, 5}
	fmt.Println(r.Height, r.Width)
	
	p := &r
	p.Height = 8
	fmt.Println(r.Height, r.Width)
}
```

- Struct literal: newly allocated struct value; lists the values of its fields [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground]()
```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Person struct {
	Name, Age string
}

var p = Person{"Mavi", "2"}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(p)
}
```

- Can also list a subset of fields by using the `Name:` syntax; order of named fields is irrelevant [1]
- `&` prefix returns a pointer to the struct value [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground]()
```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Person struct {
	Name, Age string
}

var p = Person{Age: "2"}
var ptr = &Person{"Mavi", "2"}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(p, ptr)
}
```

### Arrays
- Type `[n]T` is an array of `n` values of type `T`[1]
- An array's length is part of its type; arrays cannot be resized [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground]()
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	arr := [10]int
	fmt.Println(arr)
}
```

### Slices
- Slices are a dynamically-sizedd, flexible view into the elements of an array [1]
- Type `[]T` is a slice of type `T` [1]
- Slices can be declared, and are also formed by specifying two indices (a low and a high bound) separated by a colon: `a[low : high]` [1]
- `a[low : high]` selects a half-open range including the first element, and excluding the last one [1]
- [Visit this example in the Go Playground]()
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s1 := []int{1, 2, 3}
	arr := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
	s2 := arr[0:3] // same as arr[:3]
	fmt.Println(s1, s2)
}
```

- Slices do not store any data, they describe a section of an underlying array [1]
- Changing the elements of a slice modifies the corresponding elements of its underlying array [1]
- Other slices that share the same underlying array will see those changes [1]
